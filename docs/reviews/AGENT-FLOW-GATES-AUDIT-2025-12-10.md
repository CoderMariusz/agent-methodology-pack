### Agents Missing in Flows

| Agent | Expected In | Actually In | Gap |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| ORCHESTRATOR | All workflows | Most workflows | Minor - implicit in some |
| DOC-AUDITOR | All workflows | Epic, Sprint, Migration, Discovery | Feature-flow missing |
| DEVOPS-AGENT | Epic, Sprint | Epic, Sprint, Migration | Good |
| UX-DESIGNER | UI workflows | Story, Feature, Epic, Discovery | Good |
| SECURITY-AGENT | Bug (complex) | Not defined | Major gap |


---

## Issue Summary

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **story-delivery.yaml**: No explicit gate objects, enforcers, or block messages
2. **feature-flow.yaml**: All gates implicit, no quality control mechanism
3. **new-project.yaml**: No gate infrastructure at all
4. **planning-flow.yaml**: Complex workflow with no explicit gates

### Major Issues (Should Fix)

1. **epic-workflow.yaml**: No block messages for any gate
2. **sprint-workflow.yaml**: Missing gate enforcers, no daily cycle gates
3. **migration-workflow.yaml**: No gate enforcers or block messages
4. **All workflows**: Inconsistent gate definition patterns

### Minor Issues (Fix When Possible)

1. **bug-workflow.yaml**: Block messages only in summary section
2. **ad-hoc-flow.yaml**: Block messages only in summary section
3. **quick-fix.yaml**: Assess phase has no explicit gate
4. **discovery-flow.yaml**: Block messages not defined despite good structure

### Patterns Found

1. **Good Pattern**: bug-workflow.yaml has most comprehensive gate structure
2. **Good Pattern**: discovery-flow.yaml uses typed gates (quality_gate, approval_gate)
3. **Anti-Pattern**: Many workflows use implicit checkpoints instead of explicit gates
4. **Anti-Pattern**: Block messages often defined in summary section, not inline


---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Standardize Gate Format**: Create a consistent gate object structure:
   ```yaml
   gate:
     id: GATE_NAME
     type: quality_gate | approval_gate | test_gate | decision_gate
     enforcer: agent-name | role
     criteria:
       - "Specific criterion 1"
       - "Specific criterion 2"
     on_pass: next_phase
     on_fail: action_or_phase
     block_message: "Cannot proceed to X: [reason]"
   ```

2. **Add Explicit Enforcers**: Every gate must have an enforcer that validates it

3. **Add Block Messages**: Every gate must have a clear message for when it fails

4. **Audit story-delivery.yaml**: Most used workflow has weakest gate structure

### Medium-Term Actions

1. Create gate validation tooling that enforces consistent structure
2. Add gate execution logging for debugging
3. Create gate metrics dashboard

### Quality Score

Based on the audit criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Gate Presence | 25% | 55% | 13.75% |
| Enforcer Definition | 25% | 35% | 8.75% |
| Block Messages | 20% | 30% | 6.00% |
| Criteria Specificity | 15% | 70% | 10.50% |
| Error Recovery | 15% | 65% | 9.75% |

**Overall Quality Score: 48.75% (POOR)**

This audit reveals significant gaps in gate definition consistency across workflows. The bug-workflow.yaml should serve as the reference implementation for other workflows to follow.
