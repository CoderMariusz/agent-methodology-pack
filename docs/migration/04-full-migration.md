## 4. Full Migration (1-3 days)

For larger projects (50+ files), use this comprehensive phased approach.

### Overview

Full migration is broken into 4 phases:

1. **Discovery** (2-4 hours) - Understand current state
2. **Planning** (2-4 hours) - Design migration strategy
3. **Execution** (1-2 days) - Perform migration
4. **Verification** (2-4 hours) - Validate and test

**Total time:** 1-3 days depending on project size and complexity

### Week-by-Week Plan

**For very large projects, spread over 2 weeks:**

#### Week 1: Foundation

**Monday-Tuesday:** Discovery Phase
- Audit project structure
- Document current state
- Identify all documentation
- Map dependencies

**Wednesday-Thursday:** Planning Phase
- Design migration strategy
- Create file mapping
- Plan document sharding
- Schedule execution

**Friday:** Setup
- Install methodology pack
- Create core files
- Initialize state management
- Team briefing

#### Week 2: Execution & Validation

**Monday-Wednesday:** Execution Phase
- Migrate documentation
- Shard large files
- Setup agent workspaces
- Create missing docs

**Thursday:** Verification Phase
- Run validation scripts
- Test agent workflows
- Fix broken references
- Team training

**Friday:** Launch
- Final validation
- Team onboarding
- First sprint planning
- Retrospective

### Team Coordination

**For team migrations:**

1. **Communication Plan**
   - Announce migration 1 week in advance
   - Daily standup during migration
   - Slack/Teams channel for questions
   - Document all decisions

2. **Roles**
   - **Migration Lead:** Coordinates overall effort
   - **Documentation Lead:** Handles doc migration
   - **Technical Lead:** Code structure changes
   - **Team Members:** Review and validate

3. **Parallel Work**
   - Freeze new features during migration
   - Bug fixes on separate branch
   - Merge strategy for ongoing work

4. **Training Schedule**
   ```
   Day 1: Introduction to Agent Methodology Pack (1 hour)
   Day 2: Agent workflows demonstration (1 hour)
   Day 3: Hands-on practice session (2 hours)
   Day 4: Team Q&A and refinement (1 hour)
   ```

### Risk Management

**Common risks and mitigation:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Lost documentation | Medium | High | Git backups, incremental commits |
| Team resistance | Medium | Medium | Early training, show benefits |
| Broken workflows | High | Low | Gradual adoption, fallback plan |
| Time overrun | Medium | Medium | Buffer time, phased approach |
| Tool incompatibility | Low | High | Test early, have alternatives |
