# NEW PROJECT FLOW

**Documentation for:** `.claude/workflows/definitions/product/new-project.yaml`

## Purpose

Complete workflow for new project initialization - from idea to sprint-ready state. Takes a project from initial concept through discovery, requirements, architecture, UX design, epic breakdown, and story creation until Sprint 1 is ready to begin.

## When to Use

Trigger this workflow when:
- `new_project` - Starting a completely new greenfield project
- `major_feature` - Adding a major feature that requires full analysis
- `greenfield` - Building something from scratch

## Duration & Parallelization

- **Expected Duration:** Multiple sessions across days/weeks
- **Parallelization:** Limited due to sequential dependencies (Architecture → UX → Epics → Stories)
- **Exception:** Step 5 (Epic Breakdown) runs ARCHITECT and TEST-ENGINEER in parallel

## The 8 Phases

### Phase 1: DISCOVERY (DISCOVERY-AGENT)

**Purpose:** Gather requirements through structured interview with deep business logic exploration.

**Deliverable:** `docs/0-DISCOVERY/PROJECT-UNDERSTANDING.md`

**Clarity Target:** 85% (minimum 75% to proceed)

**Interview Phases (MANDATORY):**

1. **General Understanding**
   - What is the primary purpose of this project?
   - Who are the target users?
   - What problem does it solve?

2. **Business Logic Deep Dive** (CRITICAL)
   - How does {process} work step by step?
   - What triggers {workflow}?
   - How is {resource} transported/moved/consumed?
   - What validations are required for {entity}?
   - What happens when {edge_case} occurs?
   - How do you handle {exception_scenario}?

   Examples:
   - "How is stock consumed in production?"
   - "What happens when supplier delivery is late?"

3. **Entity Details**
   - What fields does {entity} have?
   - Which fields are required vs optional?
   - What are the validation rules?
   - What relationships exist with other entities?

4. **Assumptions Validation**
   - Present all assumptions to USER
   - Ask USER to confirm or correct each one

**Quality Gate: DISCOVERY_COMPLETE**
- Requirements clarity score >= 85%

---

## State Management & Auto-Commit

After EACH phase completion:

1. **Update PROJECT-STATE.md** in root directory

   - Update current phase
   - Sync to root using `scripts/sync-state.sh --phase <phase>`

2. **Auto-commit** with descriptive message
   - Format: `{emoji} checkpoint: {message}`
   - Emojis: 🔍 discovery, 📋 prd, 🏗️ architecture, 🎨 ux, 📦 epic, 📝 stories, ✅ scope, 🏃 sprint
   - Include metrics: clarity score, ADR count, epic count, story count

## Next Workflows (Integration)

After new-project completes, continue with:

### 1. IMMEDIATE: sprint-workflow.yaml
**Purpose:** Plan implementation strategy
- Decide how many stories per sprint
- Create parallel tracks (frontend/backend/infra)
- Map dependencies between stories
- Build implementation roadmap
- Assign stories to tracks
- **Trigger:** IMMEDIATELY after new-project completes

### 2. PER STORY: story-delivery.yaml
**Purpose:** Implement each story using TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR)
- **Trigger:** For each story in sprint backlog

### 3. SUPPORTING:
- **epic-workflow.yaml** - Continue with next epic after current completes
- **feature-flow.yaml** - Add new features during development (mid-sprint)

- `slug` - Short kebab-case description: db-schema, login-endpoint, ux-form

**Special Values:**
- `XX.0.*` - Epic-level documents (overview, clarifications, test-strategy)

### Documentation Files

```

- Revise wireframes
- Validate technical constraints
- **Escalate to:** Joint session with architect, then PRODUCT-OWNER

### Epic Structure Invalid

- Resolve circular dependencies
- Validate PRD mapping
- **Escalate to:** Return to UX, then PRODUCT-OWNER

### Stories Not INVEST
- Refine story granularity
- Add missing acceptance criteria

- **Escalate to:** Return to epic breakdown

### Capacity Exceeded
- Reprioritize sprint backlog
- Move stories to next sprint
- Adjust velocity assumptions
- **Escalate to:** PRODUCT-OWNER for prioritization

## Key Changes from Previous Version

1. **85% Clarity Threshold** - Raised from 70% at DISCOVERY phase
2. **Parallel Test Strategy** - TEST-ENGINEER runs parallel with ARCHITECT at EPIC BREAKDOWN
3. **USER Approval Gates** - USER must approve at UX phase (or opt for auto-approve)
4. **Mandatory Clarifications** - Business logic questions at Discovery AND Epic phases
5. **Hierarchical Naming** - {XX}.{N}.{M}.{slug} pattern for all stories/subtasks
6. **Auto-Commit After Each Phase** - Automatic state update + git commit
7. **Next Workflows Section** - Clear handoff to sprint-workflow → story-delivery

## Success Criteria

Project is ready for development when:
- All 8 quality gates passed
- Sprint 1 backlog defined with capacity respected
- All stories INVEST compliant with testable AC
- Test strategy defined for all epics
- USER approved all UX designs
- PROJECT-STATE.md shows: phase=sprint_planning, status=completed, active_sprint=1
- Final commit: `🏃 checkpoint: Sprint 1 planned - project ready for development`
