## Step 4.1: Run Validation Script

**Duration:** 15 minutes

### Validation Checks

```markdown
## Migration Validation

### Structure Checks
- [ ] .claude/ directory exists
- [ ] .claude/agents/ subdirectories present
- [ ] .claude/workflows/ files present
- [ ] .claude/state/ files present
- [ ] docs/ structure present

### File Checks
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists
- [ ] CLAUDE.md < 70 lines
- [ ] PROJECT-STATE.md exists
- [ ] All agent definitions present
- [ ] All workflow files present

### Content Checks
- [ ] All @references valid
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] No files > 500 lines (or properly sharded)
- [ ] All state files initialized

### Agent Workspace Checks
- [ ] Workspace definitions exist
- [ ] File mappings complete
- [ ] Context strategies defined
```

---

## Step 4.2: Test Agent Loading

**Duration:** 15 minutes

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test Orchestrator
claude --project . "[ORCHESTRATOR] Read @CLAUDE.md, @PROJECT-STATE.md and summarize."

# Test Frontend Dev
claude --project . "[frontend-dev] Read @CLAUDE.md and your workspace definition."

# Test Backend Dev
claude --project . "[backend-dev] Read @CLAUDE.md and your workspace definition."
```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] All agents can load their definitions
- [ ] @references resolve correctly
- [ ] Context stays within budget
- [ ] No errors or warnings

---

## Step 4.3: Test Workflows (Optional)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Create a simple test story and verify workflow:

```markdown
[ORCHESTRATOR]

Test Story: "Update README with migration notice"

Please route this story through the story workflow to verify:
1. Story assignment works
2. Agent handoffs function
3. State updates work
```

---

## Quality Gate 4: Migration Complete

- [ ] All validation checks pass
- [ ] All agents can load successfully
- [ ] All @references work
- [ ] CLAUDE.md < 70 lines
- [ ] No orphaned files
- [ ] Workflows tested
- [ ] Team can use methodology

---

## Error Recovery

### If Issues Discovered in Phase 3

```
1. STOP migration immediately
2. Document what went wrong
3. Revert to backup:
   - If Git branch: git checkout main
   - If backup: restore from backup
4. Review issue
5. Adjust MIGRATION-PLAN.md
6. Re-attempt with fixes
```

### If Validation Fails in Phase 4

```
1. Identify specific failures
2. Fix issues in place (if minor)
3. Re-run validation
4. If major issues:
   - Revert to backup
   - Adjust plan
   - Re-execute affected phases
```

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# If Git branch used
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/agent-methodology-migration

# If backup used
rm -rf .claude/
rm -rf docs/
cp -r backup/. .

# Verify rollback
ls -la
```

## Common Error Recovery

### Error: CLAUDE.md Exceeds 70 Lines

**Recovery:**
1. Identify verbose sections
2. Extract to referenced files
3. Replace with `@reference.md` syntax
4. Re-validate line count

### Error: Broken @References After Migration

**Recovery:**
1. Run reference validation
2. Fix each broken reference
3. Update relative paths
4. Re-validate

### Error: Large File Not Properly Sharded

**Recovery:**
1. Re-analyze file structure
2. Create better shard boundaries
3. Re-split file
4. Update index and references
5. Verify all shards < 500 lines

### Error: Agent Cannot Load Workspace

**Recovery:**
1. Check workspace definition exists
2. Verify all @references in workspace
3. Test loading manually
4. Fix path issues
5. Re-test with agent

---

## State Updates

### After Verification Success

```markdown
## PROJECT-STATE.md Update

**Phase:** Migration Complete → Ready for Development
**Last Activity:** Migration validated successfully
**Next:** Begin first epic/sprint

## METRICS.md Update
- Migration completed: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- Total duration: {duration}
- Validation: PASSED
```

## Post-Migration Checklist

### Immediate
- [ ] Update team documentation
- [ ] Train team on methodology

- [ ] Begin first epic/sprint

### Integration with Other Workflows

| Scenario | Integration |
|----------|-------------|
| After migration, start first epic | → EPIC-WORKFLOW.md |
| Need to fix migration issues | → BUG-WORKFLOW.md |
| Define first sprint | → SPRINT-WORKFLOW.md |
| Implement first story | → STORY-WORKFLOW.md |
| Ongoing doc maintenance | → tech-writer agent |
