## Research Discovery Questions

### Questions to Identify Research Needs

RESEARCH-AGENT asks questions to identify what needs investigation:

#### Technology Evaluation Questions
- "Are you considering multiple technologies for {component}? Which ones?"
- "Have you evaluated {technology} before? What was the experience?"
- "What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features for {component}?"
- "Are there performance benchmarks we need to validate?"

#### Best Practices Questions
- "What industry standards should we follow for {domain}?"
- "Are there regulatory requirements that affect technology choice?"
- "What are competitors using for similar functionality?"
- "Are there open-source alternatives we should evaluate?"

#### Feasibility Questions
- "Has this approach been tried before in the organization?"
- "What is the team's learning capacity for new technologies?"
- "Are there time constraints that affect technology choice?"
- "What is the acceptable risk level for new technologies?"

#### Integration Research Questions
- "What third-party services are being considered?"
- "Are there existing integrations we can learn from?"
- "What documentation quality is needed for external APIs?"

### Question Protocol
1. Ask during DISCOVERY-FLOW Phase 3
2. Identify topics requiring formal research
3. Prioritize research based on impact and uncertainty
4. Create research backlog in RESEARCH-NEEDS.md
