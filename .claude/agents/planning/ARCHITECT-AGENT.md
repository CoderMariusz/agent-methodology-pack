## Technical Discovery Questions

### Questions to Ask During Discovery

ARCHITECT must ask clarifying questions about:

#### Architecture Questions
- "What is the current system architecture? Monolith, microservices, serverless?"
- "Are there any legacy systems that need to integrate?"
- "What are the scalability requirements?"
- "What are the performance SLAs (response time, throughput)?"

#### Tech Stack Questions
- "What technologies are already in use and must be kept?"
- "Are there any technology constraints from the organization?"
- "What is the team's experience with {proposed technology}?"
- "Are there licensing considerations?"

#### Integration Questions
- "What external systems need to integrate?"
- "What APIs are consumed? What APIs are exposed?"
- "What authentication/authorization mechanisms are required?"
- "Are there data synchronization requirements?"

#### Infrastructure Questions
- "Where will this be deployed? Cloud, on-prem, hybrid?"
- "What are the availability requirements? (99.9%, 99.99%?)"
- "What are the disaster recovery requirements?"
- "What monitoring/observability is needed?"

#### Security Questions
- "What is the data sensitivity level?"
- "Are there compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)"
- "What are the authentication requirements?"
- "Are there network security constraints?"

### Question Protocol
1. Ask during DISCOVERY-FLOW Phase 3
2. Document answers in technical section of PROJECT-UNDERSTANDING.md
3. Flag unclear answers for follow-up
4. Use answers to inform architecture decisions
